What is Pay in 4?
Pay in 4 is a popular installment payment service offered by various financial tech companies, allowing consumers to split their purchases into four interest-free payments. The plan typically spans six weeks, with payments taken every two weeks. This flexible payment option has become increasingly common in e-commerce, providing a budget-friendly way to make larger purchases without paying the full amount upfront.

For gaming enthusiasts, this means that rather than having to pay the full price for digital content, you can break the cost into manageable installments, which can be especially useful when purchasing high-cost games, DLCs (downloadable content), or subscriptions.

What is Zip?
Zip is a payment platform that lets you buy now and pay later. As a “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) provider, Zip allows consumers to make online purchases and split the cost into smaller payments, similar to Pay in 4. Zip is accepted by many retailers, including those that sell digital goods like PSN gift cards. By using Zip, you can shop on various websites, including PlayStation’s official store or other third-party platforms that sell PSN gift cards.

Zip makes purchasing more accessible to those who may not want to commit to a full upfront payment or those who prefer to spread the cost over time. It’s a great option for gamers looking to keep their spending under control while still enjoying their favorite content.

How to Buy Digital PSN Gift Cards with Zip

Head to your preferred online retailer or marketplace where digital PSN gift cards are available. These can be purchased in a variety of denominations, including $10, $20, $50, or higher amounts, and are available for immediate delivery via email.

Step 2: Select Zip at Checkout
When you’re ready to check out, look for the payment options. Zip should be listed as one of the available payment methods. If you’re a first-time Zip user, you may need to sign up for an account and provide some personal details. After that, you can easily link your payment methods (like a debit or credit card) and proceed with the payment process.

Step 3: Choose Your Pay in 4 Option
Once you select Zip at checkout, you’ll be prompted to choose the Pay in 4 payment plan. This will allow you to break the total cost of the gift card into four equal payments over six weeks. After confirming your choice, your digital PSN gift card will be sent to your email address, and you can begin using it immediately.
